# OpenMAX IL demos for Raspberry Pi

I wanted to develop a program that utilizes
[the RaspiCam camera board for the Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/camera).
[The Raspberry Pi Foundation](http://www.raspberrypi.org/about) provides
[RaspiVid command-line application](https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland/blob/master/host_applications/linux/apps/raspicam/RaspiVid.c)
that can record video using the RaspiCam. However, this wasn't flexible enough
for my needs so I decided to learn how one can utilize the RaspiCam
programmatically from within one's own application code.

Initially I had no idea what would be needed. I did my research and found out
that you could use OpenMAX IL API to drive the RaspiCam and VideoCore hardware
video encoder on the RaspberryPi to get H.264 encoded high-definition video out
of the system in real time.

So I spent countless of hours reading the OpenMAX IL API specification and some
existing code using OpenMAX IL API (see [References] section below). However,
it was all very difficult to understand due to the complexity of the spec and
layering of the sample code. I wanted to go to the basics and write trivial,
uncapsulated demo code in order to learn how things fundamentally worked.

And here is the result. Because of the lack of simple sample code I decided to
document, package and share my work. Maybe it helps other people in similar
situation.

## Downloading

OpenMAX IL demos for Raspberry Pi home page is at
<http://solitudo.net/software/raspberrypi/rpi-openmax-demos/> and it can be
downloaded by cloning the public Git repository at
`git://scm.solitudo.net/rpi-openmax-demos.git`.
Gitweb interface is available at
<http://scm.solitudo.net/gitweb/public/rpi-openmax-demos.git>.
The software is also available at [GitHub](https://github.com) page
<https://github.com/tjormola/rpi-openmax-demos/>.

## Installation

This code has been developed and tested on [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org)
operating system running on Raspberry Pi Model B Rev. 1.0. You need the
standard GCC compiler toolchain, GNU Make and Raspberry Pi system libraries
development files installed, i.e. the following packages must be installed.

    gcc make libraspberrypi-dev

The binaries can be then compiled by running `make` command in the cloned Git
repository base directory. No special installation is required, you can just
run the self-contained binaries directly from the source directory.

## Code structure

This is not elegant or efficient code. It's aiming to be as simple as possible
and each demo program is fully self-contained. That means hundreds of lines of
duplicated helper and boiler-plate code in each demo program source code file.
The relevant OpenMAX IL code is all sequentally placed inside a single main
routine in each demo program in order to make it simple to follow what is
happening. Error handling is dead simple - if something goes wrong, report the
error and exit immediatelly. Other anti-patterns, such as busy waiting instead
of proper signaling based control of the flow of execution, are also emloyed in
the name of simplicity. Try not to be distracted by these flaws. This code is
not for production usage but to show how things work in a simple way.

The program flow in each demo program goes as described here.

1. Comment header with usage instructions
1. Hard-coded configuration parameters
1. General helper routines
1. Signal and event handler routines
1. Main routine implementing the program logic
    1. Initialization
    1. Component creation
    1. Component configuration
    1. Enable component execution
        1. Tunneling of the subsequent components in the pipeline
        1. Enabling of relevant component ports
        1. Changing of the component states
    1. Buffer allocation
    1. Main program loop
    1. Clean up and resource de-allocation
        1. Flushing of the buffers
        1. Disabling of relevant component ports
        1. De-allocation of the buffers
        1. Changing of the component states
        1. De-allocation of the component handles
    1. Program exit

## Usage

This section describes each program included in this demo bundle. Common to
each program is that any data is written to `stdout` and read from `stdin`.
Quite verbose status messages are printed to `stderr`. There is no command-line
switches. All configuration is hard-coded and can be found at the top of the
each `.c` source code file. Execution of each program can be stopped by sending
`INT`, `TERM` or `QUIT` signal to the process e.g. by pressing `Ctrl-C` when
the program is running.

### rpi-camera-encode

`rpi-camera-encode` records video using the RaspiCam module and encodes the
stream using the VideoCore hardware encoder using H.264 codec. The raw H.264
stream is emitted to `stdout`. In order to properly display the encoded video,
it must be wrapped inside a container format, e.g.
[Matroska](http://matroska.org/technical/specs/).

The following exaple uses `mkvmerge` tool from the
[MKVToolNix](http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/) software package to
create a Matroska video file from the recorded H.264 file and then play it using
[omxplayer](https://github.com/huceke/omxplayer) (although omxplayer happens to
deal also with the raw H.264 stream, but generally other players, such
[avplay](http://libav.org/avplay.html), don't).

    $ ./rpi-camera-encode >test.h264
    # Press Ctrl-C to interrupt the recording...
    $ mkvmerge -o test.mkv test.h264
    $ omxplayer test.mkv

`rpi-camera-encode` uses `camera`, `video_encode` and `null_sink` components.
`camera` video output port is tunneled to `video_encode` input port and
`camera` preview output port is tunneled to `null_sink` input port. H.264
encoded video is read from the buffer of `video_encode` output port and dumped
to `stdout`.

### rpi-camera-playback

`rpi-camera-playback` records video using the RaspiCam module and displays it
on the Raspberry Pi frame buffer display device, i.e. it should be run on the
Raspbian console.

    $ ./rpi-camera-playback

`rpi-camera-playback` uses `camera`, `video_render` and `null_sink` components.
`camera` video output port is tunneled to `video_render` input port and
`camera` preview output port is tunneled to `null_sink` input port.
`video_render` component uses a display region to show the video on local
display.

### rpi-camera-dump-yuv

`rpi-camera-dump-yuv` records video using the RaspiCam module and dumps the raw
YUV frame data to `stdout`.

    $ ./rpi-camera-dump-yuv >test.yuv

`rpi-camera-dump-yuv` uses `camera` and `null_sink` components. Uncompressed
raw YUV frame data is read from the buffer of `camera` video output port and
dumped to stdout and `camera` preview output port is tunneled to `null_sink`
input port.

Also see the [Bugs] section below.

### rpi-encode-yuv

`rpi-encode-yuv` reads raw YUV frame data from `stdin`, encodes the stream
using the VideoCore hardware encoder using H.264 codec and emits the H.264
stream to `stdout`.

    $ ./rpi-encode-yuv <test.yuv >test.h264

`rpi-encode-yuv` uses the `video_encode` component. Uncompressed raw YUV frame
data is read from `stdin` and passed to the buffer of input port of
`video_encode`. H.264 encoded video is read from the buffer of `video_encode`
output port and dumped to `stdout`.

Also see the [Bugs] section below.

## Bugs

The YUV frame data emitted by `rpi-camera-dump-yuv` is not compatible with the
encoding setup used in `rpi-encode-yuv`. The resulting H.264 encoded video is
disorted and greenish, i.e. this produces corrupted video:

    $ ./rpi-camera-dump-yuv | ./rpi-encode-yuv >test.h264

I don't understand why, because defaults are being used at both ends.
`rpi-camera-encode`, which does essentially the same thing but inside the
VideoCore pipeline, works just great. Someone please help me with this ;)

There's probably many bugs in component configuration and freeing of resources
and also buffer management (things done in incorrect order etc.). Feel free to
submit patches in order to clean things up.
